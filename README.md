# Water-Cleaning Robot – Turtlesim Simulation

## Introduction

This document outlines the simulation of an autonomous floating robot built to detect and remove debris from water surfaces. The virtual environment is developed using the `turtlesim` package within the Robot Operating System (ROS) and mimics the expected behavior of a future physical prototype.

The robot operates in a 2D space and identifies virtual waste based on color. Upon detection, it navigates toward the object and simulates a cleaning task by marking the area. This logic imitates a real-world implementation where a camera module and color filtering enable object recognition, and an embedded system controls the movement.

This project also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for the 2030 Agenda. For example, goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation** – Encouraging proactive waste removal from aquatic environments and goal 14: Life Below Water** – Supporting pollution reduction efforts in marine ecosystems.

## System Overview

- The robot is implemented using the `turtlesim` package in ROS and programmed in Python.  
- A single virtual object (waste) is generated at a random position and assigned a fixed color.  
- The robot scans a 120° field of view to detect the object.  
- Upon detection, the robot moves toward the waste and simulates a cleaning operation.  
- After completion, the robot is reset, and the process can be repeated with a newly generated object.

## Theoretical Framework

### 1. Visual Object Recognition

The simulation uses color-coded objects for detection within a simplified vision cone. This models basic computer vision principles used in robotic systems for real-time object identification.

### 2. ROS Architecture

ROS provides a distributed computing framework that allows various components to communicate efficiently. In this simulation, service calls handle turtle management, while topics manage movement and feedback.

### 3. Turtlesim

Turtlesim is a 2D simulator designed to teach ROS fundamentals. Though minimal, it is ideal for prototyping robot logic such as navigation, control loops, and perception simulation.

### 4. Proportional Control

The robot uses a proportional control loop to correct its heading based on the angular difference to the target. This method optimizes energy use by avoiding unnecessary motion until the robot is properly aligned.

### 5. Energy Consumption Metric

To evaluate efficiency, the simulation uses estimated **energy consumption** as its primary metric. It approximates energy usage based on the robot’s linear and angular velocities:

\[
E = k \cdot (v^2 + \omega^2) \cdot t
\]

This equation allows us to monitor the trade-offs between motion control and energy efficiency.

## Code Implementation and Explanation

        rospy.Subscriber('/turtle1/pose', Pose, self.update_pose)
        self.pose = Pose()

        self.energy_used = []

    def update_pose(self, data):
        self.pose = data

    def reset_robot(self):
        self.set_pen(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
        self.teleport(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
        self.set_pen(255, 255, 255, 3, 0)
        rospy.sleep(1)

    def spawn_trash(self):
        x = random.uniform(2.0, 10.0)
        y = random.uniform(2.0, 10.0)
        self.spawn(x, y, 0, 'trash')
        return (x, y)

    def move_to(self, x_goal, y_goal):
        vel = Twist()
        rate = rospy.Rate(10)
        k_linear = 0.5
        k_angular = 3.0
        start_time = time.perf_counter()
        energy = 0.0

        while not rospy.is_shutdown():
            dx = x_goal - self.pose.x
            dy = y_goal - self.pose.y
            dist = sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)

            angle_to_goal = atan2(dy, dx)
            angle_error = angle_to_goal - self.pose.theta
            angle_error = (angle_error + pi) % (2 * pi) - pi  # Normalize

            if dist < 0.1:
                break

            vel.linear.x = k_linear if abs(angle_error) < 0.1 else 0.0
            vel.angular.z = k_angular * angle_error
            self.vel_pub.publish(vel)

            # Approximate energy = v² + w²
            energy += pow(vel.linear.x, 2) + pow(vel.angular.z, 2)
            rate.sleep()

        vel.linear.x = 0
        vel.angular.z = 0
        self.vel_pub.publish(vel)
        end_time = time.perf_counter()

        total_energy = energy * (end_time - start_time) / 10
        self.energy_used.append(total_energy)
        self.kill("trash")

    def run(self, trials=3):
        for _ in range(trials):
            self.reset_robot()
            x, y = self.spawn_trash()
            rospy.sleep(1)
            self.move_to(x, y)

        print("Energy used per attempt:", [f"{e:.2f}" for e in self.energy_used])
        avg = sum(self.energy_used) / len(self.energy_used)
        print(f"Average energy: {avg:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        robot = EnergyRobot()
        rospy.sleep(2)
        robot.run()

## Performance Metric Evaluation

The simulation evaluates the robot's performance by estimating its energy usage during motion. Instead of prioritizing time-to-completion, this approach emphasizes efficient pathing and movement strategy.

### *1st Attempt*
- Energy consumed: **16.21 units**

### *2nd Attempt*
- Energy consumed: **13.94 units**

### *3rd Attempt*
- Energy consumed: **17.48 units**

**Average energy consumption:** **15.88 units**

## Justification

Variation in energy use is primarily influenced by two factors:

- **Initial orientation** relative to the waste location
- **Distance** from the robot's starting point

Shorter distances and near-perfect initial alignment result in lower energy usage. Higher angular corrections and longer paths significantly increase energy consumption.

This demonstrates the importance of efficient orientation and accurate path planning in autonomous systems, especially when energy optimization is a priority.

## Conclusions

This simulation project demonstrated how a virtual robot can be programmed to perform waste removal tasks efficiently in a controlled environment. By using energy usage as the main evaluation criterion, we introduced a performance perspective focused on sustainability and real-world constraints.

Key lessons include:

- Proportional control significantly reduces unnecessary movements.  
- Angular misalignment plays a larger role in energy inefficiency than distance.  
- ROS offers a powerful yet accessible platform for developing robotic systems even at early prototype stages.

Future work may include introducing obstacles, dynamic targets, or even reinforcement learning techniques to further improve performance.
