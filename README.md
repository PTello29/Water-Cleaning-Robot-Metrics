# Water-Cleaning Robot – Turtlesim Simulation

## Introduction

Safeguarding aquatic ecosystems has become a critical focus area in modern robotics and environmental engineering. As pollution levels rise in lakes, rivers, and coastal zones, autonomous solutions are increasingly sought after to mitigate human impact. This project introduces a simulated autonomous robot designed to identify and remove floating waste in a controlled virtual environment using the turtlesim package and ROS (Robot Operating System).

The robot operates in a 2D space, detecting a colored object that symbolizes surface-level debris. Upon detection, it navigates toward the target and simulates a cleaning action. Though simple in implementation, the behavior mirrors the fundamental logic behind real-world robots that use computer vision (e.g., OpenCV) and microcontroller integration to execute similar tasks.

This simulation is not only a technical experiment but also a conceptual contribution to sustainable development. By replicating environmental cleanup operations through automation, it aligns with key objectives in the United Nations 2030 Agenda, particularly the goal 6 of Clean Water and Sanitation that is supporting initiatives that reduce contamination in water bodies and the goal 14 ofLife Below Water  that is enhancing the conservation of aquatic biodiversity through pollution control.

Projects like this highlight the potential of robotics to assist in real-world ecological challenges while fostering awareness of technology’s role in environmental stewardship.

## System Overview

- The robot is implemented using the `turtlesim` package in ROS and programmed in Python.  
- A single virtual object (waste) is generated at a random position and assigned a fixed color.  
- The robot scans a 120° field of view to detect the object.  
- Upon detection, the robot moves toward the waste and simulates a cleaning operation.  
- After completion, the robot is reset, and the process can be repeated with a newly generated object.

## Theoretical Framework

### 1. Visual Object Recognition

The simulation uses color-coded objects for detection within a simplified vision cone. This models basic computer vision principles used in robotic systems for real-time object identification.

### 2. ROS Architecture

ROS provides a distributed computing framework that allows various components to communicate efficiently. In this simulation, service calls handle turtle management, while topics manage movement and feedback.

### 3. Turtlesim

Turtlesim is a 2D simulator designed to teach ROS fundamentals. Though minimal, it is ideal for prototyping robot logic such as navigation, control loops, and perception simulation.

### 4. Proportional Control

The robot uses a proportional control loop to correct its heading based on the angular difference to the target. This method optimizes energy use by avoiding unnecessary motion until the robot is properly aligned.

### 5. Energy Consumption Metric

Rather than speed or timing, this simulation uses **energy consumption** as its primary performance metric. This is computed using the formula:

Energy $= \int (F \cdot v)dt$

Assuming constant force and approximating based on duration and velocity, energy consumption can be expressed as proportional to:

$E = k \cdot (v^2 + \omega^2) \cdot t$

Where:

- \( $v$ \) = linear velocity  
- \( $\omega$ \) = angular velocity  
- \( $t$ \) = total movement time  
- \( $k$ \) = arbitrary proportional constant  

This allows us to assess how efficiently the robot completes its task.

        self.set_pen = rospy.ServiceProxy('/turtle1/set_pen', SetPen)
        self.energy_used = []

    def update_pose(self, data):
        self.pose = data

    def reset_robot(self):
        self.set_pen(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
        self.teleport(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
        self.set_pen(255, 255, 255, 3, 0)
        rospy.sleep(1)

    def spawn_trash(self):
        x = random.uniform(2.0, 10.0)
        y = random.uniform(2.0, 10.0)
        self.spawn(x, y, 0, 'trash')
        return (x, y)

    def move_to(self, x_goal, y_goal):
        vel = Twist()
        rate = rospy.Rate(10)
        k_linear = 0.5
        k_angular = 3.0
        start_time = time.perf_counter()
        energy = 0.0

        while not rospy.is_shutdown():
            dx = x_goal - self.pose.x
            dy = y_goal - self.pose.y
            dist = sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)

            angle_to_goal = atan2(dy, dx)
            angle_error = angle_to_goal - self.pose.theta
            angle_error = (angle_error + pi) % (2 * pi) - pi  # Normalize

            if dist < 0.1:
                break

            vel.linear.x = k_linear if abs(angle_error) < 0.1 else 0.0
            vel.angular.z = k_angular * angle_error
            self.vel_pub.publish(vel)

            # Approximate energy = v² + w²
            energy += pow(vel.linear.x, 2) + pow(vel.angular.z, 2)
            rate.sleep()

        vel.linear.x = 0
        vel.angular.z = 0
        self.vel_pub.publish(vel)
        end_time = time.perf_counter()

        total_energy = energy * (end_time - start_time) / 10
        self.energy_used.append(total_energy)
        self.kill("trash")

    def run(self, trials=3):
        for _ in range(trials):
            self.reset_robot()
            x, y = self.spawn_trash()
            rospy.sleep(1)
            self.move_to(x, y)

        print("Energy used per attempt:", [f"{e:.2f}" for e in self.energy_used])
        avg = sum(self.energy_used) / len(self.energy_used)
        print(f"Average energy: {avg:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        robot = EnergyRobot()
        rospy.sleep(2)
        robot.run()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass
```
This Python script implements a simulated robot using ROS (Robot Operating System) and `turtlesim`, which moves towards a random object (represented as "trash") and calculates the estimated energy consumption based on its movement.

```python
import rospy, time, random
from math import atan2, sqrt, pow, pi
from turtlesim.srv import Spawn, Kill, TeleportAbsolute, SetPen
from turtlesim.msg import Pose
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
```

These libraries allow:

- ROS management (rospy)
- Random generation (random)
- Mathematical calculations (distance, angle, energy)
- Turtlesim-specific services and messages and geometry_msgs

Initialization
```python
def __init__(self):
    rospy.init_node("energy_cleaner")
    self.vel_pub = rospy.Publisher('/turtle1/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10)
    rospy.Subscriber('/turtle1/pose', Pose, self.update_pose)
    ...
```

- Create a ROS node named "energy_cleaner".
- Publish velocity commands to /turtle1/cmd_vel.
- Listen to the turtle's position in /turtle1/pose.
- Set up services to spawn, delete, and teleport turtles.

Position Update

```python
def update_pose(self, data):
    self.pose = data
```

Updates the turtle's current position as data is received from the /turtle1/pose topic.

Robot Reset

```python
def reset_robot(self):
    self.set_pen(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
    self.teleport(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    self.set_pen(255, 255, 255, 3, 0)
```
    
- Turn off the pen to avoid drawing lines.
- Reposition the turtle to (1.0, 1.0).
- Reactivate the pen to draw.

Generation of "garbage"

```python
def spawn_trash(self):
    x = random.uniform(2.0, 10.0)
    y = random.uniform(2.0, 10.0)
    self.spawn(x, y, 0, 'trash')
    return (x, y)
```

A new turtle called 'trash' appears in a random position in the environment.

Movement towards the goal

```python
def move_to(self, x_goal, y_goal):
    ...
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        ...
        vel.linear.x = k_linear if abs(angle_error) < 0.1 else 0.0
        vel.angular.z = k_angular * angle_error
        ...
        energy += pow(vel.linear.x, 2) + pow(vel.angular.z, 2)
```
        
- Calculates the distance and angle to the target.
- Moves only if the angle is small (avoids moving in the wrong direction).
- Calculates energy as v² + w² at each step (approximation of effort).
- Upon arrival, stops movement and removes debris.

Main Execution

```python
def run(self, trials=3):
    for _ in range(trials):
        self.reset_robot()
        x, y = self.spawn_trash()
        rospy.sleep(1)
        self.move_to(x, y)
    ...
```

- Run multiple trials of the process:
- Initial repositioning.
- Garbage generation.
- Movement toward the target.
- At the end, print the energy used in each trial and the average.

Main Block

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        robot = EnergyRobot()
        rospy.sleep(2)
        robot.run()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass
```

Create the EnergyRobot object, wait for ROS to stabilize, and execute the run method.

## Performance Metric Evaluation

The simulation evaluates the robot's performance by estimating its energy usage during motion. Instead of prioritizing time-to-completion, this approach emphasizes efficient pathing and movement strategy.

### *1st Attempt*
- Energy consumed: **16.21 units**

### *2nd Attempt*
- Energy consumed: **13.94 units**

### *3rd Attempt*
- Energy consumed: **17.48 units**

**Average energy consumption:** **15.88 units**

## Justification

Variation in energy use is primarily influenced by two factors:

- **Initial orientation** relative to the waste location
- **Distance** from the robot's starting point

Shorter distances and near-perfect initial alignment result in lower energy usage. Higher angular corrections and longer paths significantly increase energy consumption.

This demonstrates the importance of efficient orientation and accurate path planning in autonomous systems, especially when energy optimization is a priority.

## Conclusions

This simulation project demonstrated how a virtual robot can be programmed to perform waste removal tasks efficiently in a controlled environment. By using energy usage as the main evaluation criterion, we introduced a performance perspective focused on sustainability and real-world constraints.

Key lessons include:

- Proportional control significantly reduces unnecessary movements.  
- Angular misalignment plays a larger role in energy inefficiency than distance.  
- ROS offers a powerful yet accessible platform for developing robotic systems even at early prototype stages.

Future work may include introducing obstacles, dynamic targets, or even reinforcement learning techniques to further improve performance.
